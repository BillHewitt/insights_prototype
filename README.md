# README

To Do

We need to install the remark them in Ruby on rails.

Here is the theme: https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/index.html

*Please can we pull the nav-bar and menu-bar into its own partial.

*Please add the following key pages as separate pages in ruby on rails to ensure they work as per the demo (the pages have already been setup in the rails project)

https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/index.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/apps/taskboard/taskboard.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/apps/contacts/contacts.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/charts/gauges.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/charts/chartjs.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/forms/general.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/dashboard/team.html
https://getbootstrapadmin.com/remark/base/widgets/data.html
All the Basic UI elements need to work too

Push the work to github and heroku to ensure itâ€™s working.

The final ruby pages should look identical to the Remark demo theme.

The Remark theme lives in insights_prototype > public > remark.
